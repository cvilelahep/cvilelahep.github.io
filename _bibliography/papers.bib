-- While this publication falls somewhat outside of my main research interests, it is of high significance to Super-Kamiokande, describing a measurement of a process which is a background to the search for the diffuse supernova neutrino flux, one of the main near-term goals of the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration. I was assigned to the paper editing committee as an atmospheric neutrino expert. During the review I identified a significant shortcoming in the analysis related to the treatment of \emph{neutrino-nucleus interaction model uncertainties}. I suggested a method to estimate these uncertainties and a change to the event selection criteria that made the analysis substantially more \emph{robust}. Both my suggestions were implemented and significantly improved the quality of the analysis, which sailed through the \emph{Phys. Rev.} D peer-review process.}
